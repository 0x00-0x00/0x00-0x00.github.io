Hello all! I intend to continue my work in personal blogging in this small space. 

Previously I was using a private virtual server to host a Wordpress blog and it was very fancy, but it was giving me too much work, and I do already have enough work to do, so I left it aside. But I do like blogging about hacking and penetration testing, so here I am again. 

This Jekyll blog and GitHub Pages structure seems tight and easy, so I will give it a try.

Until next post, I assume!
